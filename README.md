# Assembly ML
## Aim: To create white-box machine learning models in nasm assembly

### Step 1:
First I must learn how to read in a file and print its contents in nasm
Completed in Step1-ReadingFiles
To use the program type
```
./readingFiles
```
and when prompted (for example), enter
```
textToRead.txt
```

### Step 2:
Now I learn how to sum up numbers, that are written in a text file
Completed in Step2-summingNumbers
To use the program type:
```
./summingNumbers
```
and when prompted (for example), enter
```
example1.csv
```
Or create a csv file with numbers separated by commas.

### Step 3:
Now I make a linear regression model using the reading files and summing numbers modules
Completed in Step3-linearRegression
To use the program type:
```
./linearRegression
```
and when prompted (for example), enter
```
dustyMartinExample.csv
```
The dusty martin example has data from his seasons where x = games played and y = total goals scored.
When prompted you can give the program any file that is a csv (or otherwise) with two columns: x and y - dont label the columns however
